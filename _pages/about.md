I am Shayan (pronounced "Shaw Yawn") Majidy, a Vanier Scholar and PhD Candidate at the Perimeter Institute and the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo.

I'm also a co-author of _Building Quantum Computers: A practical introduction_ by Majidy, Wilson and Laflamme (Cambridge University Press, 2024).

Research Interests
======
My research is centred on the dynamics of quantum information---specifically, on how non-classical properties of information are generated, harnessed, or lost and the physical consequences that ensue in the domains of thermodynamics and many-body physics.
