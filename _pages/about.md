I am Shayan (pronounced "Shaw Yawn") Majidy, a Vanier Scholar and PhD Candidate at the Perimeter Institute and the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo. 

Research Interests
======
My research is centred on the dynamics of quantum information---specifically, on how non-classical properties of information are generated, harnessed, or lost and the physical consequences that ensue in the domains of thermodynamics and many-body physics. 

Education
======
* Ph.D in Physics (Quantum Information), University of Waterloo, 2019-2023 (expected)
* M.Sc. in Physics (Quantum Information), University of Waterloo, 2018-2019 (expected)
* B.Sc. in Theoretical Physics, University of Guelph, 2010-2015
